# node-sockjs-test-server
It's a repo to learn and illustrate usage of [sockjs-node](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node) server and javascript [sockjs-client](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client).

1. Run `npm install` to install sockjs
2. Run `node server.js` to run server (it will listen on 9999)
3. Go to your browser and visit `http://localhost:9999/` to visit demo site
4. Visit `http://localhost:9999/sockjs` to see sockjs endpoint
5. Use `ws://localhost:9999/sockjs/websocket` as raw websocket address.
